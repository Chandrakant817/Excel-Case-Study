    "## Numpy is one of the most commonly used packages for scientific computing in Python. It provides a multidimensional array object, as well as variations such as masks and matrices, which can be used for various math operations. Numpy is compatible with, and used by many other popular Python packages, including pandas and matplotlib. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is numpy so popular? Quite simply, because it’s faster than regular Python arrays, which lack numpy’s optimized and pre-compiled C code that does all the heavy lifting. Another reason is that numpy arrays and operations are vectorized, which means they lack explicit looping or indexing in the code. This makes the code not only more readable, but also more similar to standard mathematical notation. \n",
